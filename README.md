4chan client built using Meteor + React and Material UI.

Currently on hold until Meteor 1.3 comes out, which should improve Meteor's testability as well 
as add NPM support (without all the hackery currently going on).

- [ ] Add freakin tests
- [ ] Add Redux and rework existing code
- [ ] Fix desktop layout issues
